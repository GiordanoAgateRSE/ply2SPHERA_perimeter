# ply2SPHERA_perimeter
ply2SPHERA_perimeter v.3.0 (RSE SpA) is a minor pre-processing tool of the SPH code SPHERA v.10.0.0. It deals with the format conversion from “.ply” to the format of the sections “VERTICES” and “FACES” of SPHERA main input file to describe the perimeter of a 3D zone (for 3D simulations) or a 2D zone (for 2D simulations).
